<p>frictionful experiences on the web make me exasperated. if something doesn't do what i think it's going to do, that's annoying. if i have to slow down, that's annoying. if i have to think harder about something than i normally doâ€“ that's annoying.</p>

<p>but i would rather be slightly annoyed for the rest of my life than have to look at one more site made by developers who think bootstrap is the epitome of design. i often joke that if i see another flat-web-1.0 site with rounded corners and bright colors and flat illustrations i am going to fall down and die.</p>

<p>and not so much in the "oh, computers are too <strong>easy</strong> now, back in my day you had to navigate with only a keyboard and know all the commands" type of way, either. i just think those kind of sites lack a soul. they are highly usable, highly legible, and practically invisible.</p>

<p>if you need your webpage to be simple- i much prefer the kinds of sites that science professors make when they don't want to use Canvas; that is, completely straightforward and underdesigned. sometimes they're even in default HTML.</p>

<p>actually, even a page with lots of styling can still look underdesigned in that way that i like. but at any rate, at this point seeing a blue rounded-rectangle button with white text sends me into a completely controllable rage.</p>

<p><strong>noooo, get them away from me!!!</strong></p>
